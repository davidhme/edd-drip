Easy Digital Downloads - Drip integrates the Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) shopping cart with the Drip email marketing automation tool.

== Description ==
Built  for our own use at [FatcatApps.com](http://fatcatapps.com/), Easy Digital Downloads - Drip integrates two of our favorite tools: [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) and [Drip](https://www.getdrip.com/).

= Features =
**1. Purchase Tracking**
When a customer checks out, the following event will be fired:
`Made a purchase`

The plugin also tracks the following properties:

* `value` (Price of the product bought)
* `product_name` (Name of the product bought)
* `price_name` (The price_name [if you're using variable pricing])

All in all, the API call to Drip will look like this:
`{ "events": [{ "email": {email}, "action": "Made a purchase", "properties": { "value": {price}, "product_name": {name}, "price_name": {price_name} } }] }`

**2. Refund Tracking**
When a customer refunds (payment status = "Refunded", the following event will be fired:
`Refunded`

The plugin also tracks the following properties:

* `value` (Price of the product bought)
* `product_name` (Name of the product bought)
* `price_name` (Name of the price_name [if you're using variable pricing])

All in all, the API call to Drip will look like this:
`{ "events": [{ "email": {email}, "action": "Refunded", "properties": { "value": {price}, "product_name": {name}, "price_name": {price_name} } }] }`

**3. Cart Abandonment Tracking**
When a payment's status has been "pending" for at least 30 minutes, or when a payment's status changes to "abandoned", the following event will be fired:
`Abandoned cart`

The plugin also tracks the following properties:

* `value` (Price of the product)
* `product_name` (Name of the product)
* `price_name` (Name of the price_name [if you're using variable pricing])

All in all, the API call to Drip will look like this:
`{ "events": [{ "email": {email}, "action": "Refunded", "properties": { "value": {price}, "product_name": {name}, "price_name": {price_name} } }] }`

**4. Lifetime Value (LTV) Tracking**
This plugin tracks your customer's lifetime value in a custom field called `lifetime_value`.

If a customer makes a purchase:
`lifetime_value+={price}`

If a customer refunds:
`lifetime_value-={price}`
